In addition to presenting the NLSA Collaborative's workshop at last weekend's CSA conference, Greg shared his personal story.

Finding the Right Therapy will Change Your Life
Greg O'Grady

Originally from a small town in Newfoundland, Greg grew up with a severe stutter. As a young adult he grappled with mental health and despair challenges, but eventually made his way to the Speech and Stuttering Institute in Toronto. In this workshop, Greg will speak about his journey as a person who stutters, and the challenge of maintaining fluency learned in treatment. He will also show a fifteen minute clip of a documentary he is working on, Finding The Right Therapist and Therapy. Dedicated to Dr. Bob Kroll, his Speech-Language Pathologist who passed away this year, it features different people who stutter discussing the positive impact therapy had for them.

What to expect
This workshop will address the emotional area of stuttering, thoughts about treatment of the whole person who stutters. Also what are their thoughts about a person who stutters readiness for treatment? What are their therapeutic expectations of a client during treatment? How do they involve family / significant others in treatment? and more!
