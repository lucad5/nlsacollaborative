"ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO STUTTER"

Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association Calls for Survey Participants

(date-)

The Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) is asking people to go online and fill out a research survey that will improve services for people in the province who stutter.

The research group that developed the survey, NLSA COLLABORATIVE, is seeking four types of respondents: people who stutter, their family members, educators and speech language pathologists.

"The goal is to collect data to help enhance and improve the lives of people with speech, language and communication impairments in the province of NL," said Greg O'Grady, Chair, Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association.

Paul De Decker,  Associate Professor, Department of Linguistics, Memorial University, who oversees the research project emphasized the importance of participation from throughout Newfoundland and Labrador.

"We need people from all across the province," De Decker said, "We need to not only highlight therapeutic services already in place but also identify service gaps and barriers and gauge awareness of services that are currently available for people who stutter."

De decker says the survey is available online.
It's estimated it will take 15-45 minutes to complete.
To take the survey go to: www.nlsascollaborative.ca

Established in 2018, the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association is a volunteer-driven, not-for-profit organization that provides advocacy and support to children, adolescents, and adults who stutter, along with their families and allies, to help them achieve their full personal and professional potentials by raising awareness, education, understanding, and acceptance of stuttering.
