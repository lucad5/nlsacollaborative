This project is a sociolinguistic investigation into how identities are constructed across the lifespans of PWS. Sociolinguistic studies of identity view language as a social practice (Eckert 2000) that serves, in part, to construct identities of individuals (Johnstone 1996), emically defined social networks (Mendoza-Denton 2011) and geographic communities that share a common language (Labov 1963). In simplest terms, we use the way we talk to construct who we are, and who we desire to be. PWS, however, face a challenge introduced by their own speech. Because of the stigma associated with speech disfluencies, many PWS may attempt to hide their stutter, leading to the construction of a concealable and stigmatized identity (CSI) (Quinn and Earnshaw 2013). Hottle (1996) suggests that PWS come to acquire a CSI through others’ reacting to their stutter. Consequently, identity is not simply a product of one’s desire but is a jointly constructed process that takes place between individuals and family members, friends, and therapists and others.

We will investigate properties of CSI including how often a person thinks about their CSI (salience), the degree to which a person defines themself by stuttering (centrality), efforts to hide their stutter (concealment), and how often a person reveals their CSI and under what circumstances (disclosure). We wish to discover which factors contribute to the maintenance or cessation of concealable stigmatized identities for PWS.
