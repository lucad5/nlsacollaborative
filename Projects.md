<h3>Some Stutter, Luh!</h3>
Newfoundland and Labrador's first podcast about about living with language disorders. We speak directly to people living with speech and language disorders, and others such as speech language pathologists, researchers, educators and family members. We use inclusive language and themes to help rebuild confidence and hope by dismantling myths, stigma, stereotypes and barriers. [Go to podcast website.](https://somestutterluh.ca)

In Fall 2021 we are supported by funding from the Memorial University Career Experience Program [(MUCEP).](https://www.mun.ca/student/career-services/faculty-and-staff-hire-student-staff/memorials-undergraduate-career-experience-program/)

<h3>The Science of Stuttering</h3>
"The Science of Stuttering” is a web-based open education resource (OER) to be used as part of an existing university or college level course in phonetics, sociolinguistics, or clinical phonetics, but can also stand alone for individual use. Paul De Decker will introduce “The Science of Stuttering” as a module in his 4th year undergraduate/graduate course, Experimental Phonetics at Memorial University in Fall 2022. Many students who take this course apply to graduate programs in Speech-Language Pathology in Canada or the US. This OER will introduce these students to issues in stuttering research and help develop skills that will be useful in their future studies. It will also challenge students to understand the personal identities of people who stutter as an important factor in the clinical treatment of stuttering. This will be the first OER developed within the Department of Linguistics at Memorial which will serve to promote OER among colleagues.

This project is generously funded by an [AtlanticOER Grant](https://atlanticoer-relatlantique.ca/) to Dr. Paul De Decker. Founded by CAUL-CBUA, AtlanticOER is

> a service that supports the hosting and creation of open educational resources by educators and students by the Atlantic provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.


<h3>Stuttering and Sociolinguistic Identity: an apparent time study</h3>
This project is a sociolinguistic investigation into how identities are constructed across the lifespans of PWS. Sociolinguistic studies of identity view language as a social practice (Eckert 2000) that serves, in part, to construct identities of individuals (Johnstone 1996), emically defined social networks (Mendoza-Denton 2011) and geographic communities that share a common language (Labov 1963). The way we speak can be used to construct who we are, and who we desire to be. PWS, however, face a challenge introduced by their own speech. Because of the stigma associated with speech disfluencies, many PWS may attempt to hide their stutter, leading to the construction of a concealable and stigmatized identity (CSI) (Quinn and Earnshaw 2013). Hottle (1996) suggests that PWS come to acquire a CSI through others’ reacting to their stutter. Consequently, identity is not simply a product of one’s desire but is a jointly constructed process that takes place between individuals and family members, friends, and therapists and others.

In Fall 2021 we are supported by funding from the Graduate Student Work Experience Program [(GradSWEP).](https://www.mun.ca/student/career-services/faculty-and-staff-hire-student-staff/memorials-undergraduate-career-experience-program/)

<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
<h3>Getting the Words Out</h3>
Our first project was funded by the Undergraduate Student Summer Internship Program at Memorial University. Linguistics student, Laura Tulk, designed a survey to assess public perceptions of stuttering in NL. To help promote the mandate of the NLSA, we produced a short documentary video called "Getting the Words Out" which was nominated for Best Student Short Doc at the 2020 Silver Wave Film Festival.
