The NLSA COLLABORATIVE is a research group in solidarity with people who stutter in the province of NL. We are:

/*:
-people who stutter (PWS)
-members of provincial government
-member of the public
-school teachers
-speech-language pathologists (SLP)
-academics
-university students
-mental health professionals
-disability advocates
-NLSA members
*/

We are all brought together around a common goal to advocate for people who stutter, their service providers and our communities in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Our first project was funded by the Undergraduate Student Summer Internship Program at Memorial University. Laura Tulk designed a survey to assess public perceptions of stuttering in NL. To help promote the mandate of the NLSA, we produced a short documentary video called "Getting the Words Out" which is available on our website at nlsacollaborative.ca. It was nominated for Best Student Short Doc at the Silver Wave Film Festival.

We are now beginning our second project: the development of a series of short, accessible research surveys and participatory action events that seek to learn more about barriers people who stutter face in accessing therapeutic services. This project has benefitted from a Quick Start Grant offered by Memorial's Office of Public Engagement. We were able to hire 2 undergraduate students: with input from members of the collaborative, and through library research, Luca Dinu developed 4 sets of surveys to send out to PWS, educators, SLPs and family members of PWS.

Finally, we are proposing a third project to start later this year. It looks at how stuttering influences the identities of PWS. Because we use the way we talk to construct who we are, and who we desire to be, do PWS face a challenge introduced by their own speech?

Because of the stigma associated with speech disfluencies, many PWS may attempt to hide their stutter, leading to the construction of what's called a concealable and stigmatized identity. PWS acquire these identities through othersâ€™ reacting to their stutter. Consequently, identity is not simply a product of their desire but is a process that takes place between themselves and family members, friends, therapists and others. We hope this project will identify factors that contribute to the maintenance or cessation of concealable stigmatized identities for PWS.
