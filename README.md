Our first project was funded by the Undergraduate Student Summer Internship Program at Memorial University. Linguistics student, Laura Tulk, designed a survey to assess public perceptions of stuttering in NL. To help promote the mandate of the NLSA, we produced a short documentary video called "Getting the Words Out" which was nominated for Best Student Short Doc at the 2020 Silver Wave Film Festival.

We are now beginning our second project: the development of a series of research surveys that seek to learn more about the barriers people who stutter face in accessing therapeutic services. This project has benefitted from a Quick Start Grant offered by Memorial's Office of Public Engagement. We were able to hire an undergraduate linguistics student and with input from members of the collaborative, and through library research, Luca Dinu developed 4 sets of surveys to send out to PWS, educators, SLPs and family members of PWS.

Finally, we are proposing a third project to start later this year. It looks at how stuttering influences the identities of PWS. Because we use the way we talk to construct who we are, and who we desire to be, we want to understand the challenges that are introduced by their own speech.

Because of the stigma associated with speech disfluencies, many PWS may attempt to hide their stutter, leading to the construction of what's called a concealable and stigmatized identity. PWS acquire these identities through othersâ€™ reacting to their stutter. Consequently, identity is not simply a product of their desire but is a process that takes place between themselves and family members, friends, therapists and others. We hope this project will identify factors that contribute to the maintenance or cessation of concealable stigmatized identities for PWS.
