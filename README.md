# NLSA Collaborative Project: Survey on Barriers and Accessibility

You are invited to complete a survey about Access to Services for People Who Stutter in Newfoundland and Labrador. This survey is part of The Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association Solidarity Project, which is a cross-sector collaborative of people who stutter (PWS), members of provincial government, public-school teachers, early childhood educators, speech-language pathologists (S-LP), academics, university students, mental health professionals, disability advocates, and members of the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA). We are all brought together around a common goal to address the current needs of people who stutter in Newfoundland and Labrador. Please read the following before continuing. 



**What is this project about?**


This project has four goals: 


a) to determine how many PWS live in NL. We currently do not know this basic fact about our province.

b) to understand what services are available for Preschoolers (1-5yrs.), school age (6-13yrs), adolescents and adults (14-85 plus) who stutter, and identify any gaps in this system.

c) to gauge awareness of resources available to PWS.

d) to assess needs and access to resources for speech-language pathologists, early childhood educators, teachers, guidance counsellors, and health clinicians.



**What will you do with my survey responses?**



Data collected will be used in the following ways: 


a) as evidence to identify deficits in intensive / specialized programs and services. We believe that this will help identify / reduce / eliminate barriers to the existing, limited clinical programs, services and supports in NL. 

b) to advocate for government funding to research and establish the identified needed intensive / specialized programs, services and supports for PWS in our province. We also want to develop workshops/guides for participants to understand concealable social identities commonly held by PWS, and any mental health concerns that often go along with them. SLPs, ECE's, PWS, and community members will develop skills to become aware of the role of stigma associated with non-standard ways of speaking.

c) to identify other areas / concerns / issues related to supports and services that will require future research or surveying.



**Will my answers be anonymous and confidential?**

We are not collecting any personally identifiable data (e.g. names, addresses) from you. In this respect, your identity will remain anonymous. There are questions that ask about age, gender and other demographic information that will help us tailor the survey to your own experiences. If you leave these questions blank the website will prompt you to complete them.

All response data will be stored online through the Qualtrics website. Your responses will be stored in a password protected database. No personally identifiable information will be linked to your responses.

The following three people may access the raw data (i.e. as individual responses).  

1) Dr. Paul De Decker, an Associate Professor of Linguistics at Memorial University.

2) Greg O’Grady, Chair of the NLSA. 

3) A research assistant and member of the Solidarity Project team.



**Importantly,** at no time will any of these people know who contributed which response. 


All raw data will be retained indefinitely for the purposes of advocacy for PWS in NL. 

Stakeholders and members of the NLSA Solidarity Project will have access to results in a pooled format. We will then decide together which data will be used for advocacy purposes.

We will produce a final report that highlights any significant findings from the survey. Where appropriate, we may paraphrase information shared with us through the survey. This report will be publicly available and accessible from the project webpage at [nlsacollaborative.ca](http://nlsacollaborative.ca/)




**What else should I know?**
You are free to not take part in this survey with no penalty to you. There is also no direct benefit to you as an individual in responding to this survey though we hope that this research will lead to improved access to services for PWS and help early childhood educators, teachers, parents, and speech language pathologists in their ability to assist PWS. 

For some people, some questions that ask about negative experiences related to stuttering may cause them to feel uncomfortable. These questions are not required so if you do not wish to provide an answer you may choose to skip those questions. There is no penalty for choosing to not answer such questions.

If you experience any negative psychological discomfort please contact the Mental Health Crisis Line:709-777-3200 or Toll Free 1-1888-737-4668.

If you choose not to take part in this survey, it will not affect your relationship with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association.

Finally, if you have any questions about your participation in this survey, please contact NLSA Chair, Greg O'Grady [greg@nlsacollaborative.ca](mailto:greg@nlsacollaborative.ca) for more information.
