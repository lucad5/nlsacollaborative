In solidarity with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association, and those living with speech or language impairments, the NLSA Collaborative seeks to understand the social impact of stuttering and language disorders in Newfoundland and Labrador.

We are positioned to carry out the following research:

1. To better understand, and mitigate the social factors that create communication barriers for those who live with speech, language and voice disorders.

2. To partner with communication service providers (such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs), early childhood educators (ECEs), teachers, counsellors, and health clinicians in order to assess their needs and access to resources for working with this specific clientelle.

3. To understand the availability of services for preschoolers (1-5 yrs), school age (6-12 yrs), adolescents (13-17 yrs) and adults (18+) with communication difficulties in order to identify and fix any gaps in this system. This includes determining community awareness of these resources.

4. To survey and educate Newfoundlanders and Labradorians about communication disorders and ways to remove barriers for those who face them.

5. To conduct primary research for scholarly and public audiences on the sociolinguistic factors that underly communication disorders within the province.

6. To create, fund and distribute participant-engaged, short documentary media that communicate these goals.

Often the immediate impacts include higher rates of anxiety, depression, as well as lower qualities of life and self-esteem (Boyle, 2015) for individuals living with communication impairments. It is therefore imperative to share our findings with
and implement strategies for those who can use them. Our process encouraginges acceptance through educational, knowledge mobilizing media. (i.e. short films and podcasts) that can be used by the public to challenge, dismantle, and prevent public stigma towards people who experience the negative effects of a communication disorder. By increasing public knowledge and improving public perceptions towards impairments, knowledge-based media can play a crucial role in empowering and instilling a sense of self-worth among individuals (Budig et al. 2018).
