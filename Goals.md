In solidarity with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association, the NLSA is positioned to carry out the following research:

1. To determine how many people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador experience persistent communication difficulties due to a speech, language or voice disorder. We currently do not know this basic fact about our province.

2. To understand the availability of services for preschoolers (1-5 yrs), school age (6-12 yrs), adolescents (13-17 yrs) and adults (18+) with communication difficulties in order to identify and fix any gaps in this system. This includes determining community awareness of these resources.

3. To partner with communication service providers (such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs), early childhood educators (ECEs), teachers, counsellors, and health clinicians in order to assess their needs and access to resources for working with this specific clientelle.

4. To survey and educate Newfoundlanders and Labradorians about communication disorders and ways to remove barriers for those who face them.

5. To better understand, and mitigate the social factors that create communication barriers for those who live with speech, language and voice disorders.
